**How to use the Beluga Line Station (BLS)**
1. Upon landing, taxi to the the beluga line station and follow the instuctions of the marschaller who positiont on the T intersection on front of the line station you want to park in.(That means taht there are 2 marshallers for each linestation 1) 
2. Shut down your engines
3. Open the SAM menu and under the "controls" page, open both sets of BLS doors
4. Call Better Pushback and direct it to tow you into the building. Note: there are alignment markers (The big yellow stripes, put the main gear squares from better pushback on that line)
5. Get towed into the BLS and disconnect the tow. 
6. Close the BLS doors. You only need to close the ST doors, but you can close both if you want since the fuselage of the ST is smaller than the XL. 

To leave the BLS, call better pushback and push yourself on the taxiway with your nose facing to the runway
